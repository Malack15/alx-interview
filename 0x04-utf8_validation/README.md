UTF-8 validation ensures that a sequence of bytes conforms to the UTF-8 encoding standard, which is used to represent all Unicode characters. It involves checking that the data adheres to specific encoding rules, such as identifying valid start and continuation bytes and preventing overlong encodings or invalid code points. Proper UTF-8 validation helps prevent errors and corruption in text processing systems by ensuring that data is correctly encoded, particularly in web browsers, APIs, and databases where UTF-8 is the standard for handling multilingual text.
