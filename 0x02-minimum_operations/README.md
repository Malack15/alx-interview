The `minimum_operations` function calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific goal or transform one value into another, typically by applying a series of predefined operations such as incrementing, doubling, or halving a value. This function is commonly used in algorithmic challenges to solve optimization problems, where the objective is to determine the most efficient sequence of steps needed to reach the desired outcome. It utilizes techniques like dynamic programming or recursion to explore possible paths and identify the optimal solution, ensuring that the goal is reached with the fewest possible operations.
