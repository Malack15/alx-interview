Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The triangle starts with a 1 at the top (row 0), and each subsequent row starts and ends with 1. The other numbers in each row are obtained by adding the numbers above them from the previous row.
How It Works
Row 0: Starts with a single 1.
Row 1: Contains two 1s.
Row 2: Starts and ends with 1, and the middle number is 1 + 1 = 2.
Row 3: Starts and ends with 1, and the middle numbers are 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 1 = 3.
Row 4: Continues this pattern, with middle numbers being the sum of the two numbers directly above them: 1 + 3 = 4, 3 + 3 = 6, 3 + 1 = 4.
Mathematical Properties
Each row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion of 
(
𝑎
+
𝑏
)
𝑛
(a+b) 
n
 , where n is the row number.
The triangle exhibits symmetry; the numbers on the left side of the triangle mirror those on the right.
The sum of the numbers in the nth row is

Each number in Pascal's Triangle is a combination, often written as 
(
𝑛
𝑘
)
( 
k
n
​
 ), which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
